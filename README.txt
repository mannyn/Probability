Continuous learning probability and related math.

by Jason Brownlee

Basically my math could be better, I've forgotten most of what I learned. This
project is intended to provide a sandbox for me to implement examples and test
ideas in order to promote continuous learning of probability and related maths.

Most examples are implemented in Java as unit tests.
