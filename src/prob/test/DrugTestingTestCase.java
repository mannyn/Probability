/**
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem#Example_1:_Drug_testing
 * 
 * An example of the use of Bayes' theorem is the evaluation of drug test 
 * results. Suppose a certain drug test is 99% sensitive and 99% specific, that 
 * is, the test will correctly identify a drug user as testing positive 99% of 
 * the time, and will correctly identify a non-user as testing negative 99% of 
 * the time. This would seem to be a relatively accurate test, but Bayes' 
 * theorem can be used to demonstrate the relatively high probability of 
 * misclassifying non-users as users. Let's assume a corporation decides to 
 * test its employees for drug use, and that only 0.5% of the employees 
 * actually use the drug. What is the probability that, given a positive drug 
 * test, an employee is actually a drug user? Let "D" stand for being a drug 
 * user and "N" indicate being a non-user. Let "+" be the event of a positive 
 * drug test. We need to know the following:
 * 
 * - P(D), or the probability that the employee is a drug user, regardless of any
 *  other information. This is 0.005, since 0.5% of the employees are drug 
 *  users. This is the prior probability of D.
 * - P(N), or the probability that the employee is not a drug user. This is 
 * 1 âˆ’ P(D), or 0.995.
 * - P(+|D), or the probability that the test is positive, given that the 
 * employee is a drug user. This is 0.99, since the test is 99% accurate.
 * - P(+|N), or the probability that the test is positive, given that the 
 * employee is not a drug user. This is 0.01, since the test will produce a 
 * false positive for 1% of non-users.
 * - P(+), or the probability of a positive test event, regardless of other 
 * information. This is 0.0149 or 1.49%, which is found by adding the 
 * probability that a true positive result will appear (= 99% x 0.5% = 0.495%) 
 * plus the probability that a false positive will appear 
 * (= 1% x 99.5% = 0.995%). This is the prior probability of +.
 * 
 * Given this information, we can compute the posterior probability P(D|+) of 
 * an employee who tested positive actually being a drug user: 0.3322
 * 
 * Despite the specificity and sensitivity of the test, the low base-rate of 
 * use renders the accuracy of the test low: the probability that an employee
 * who tests positive actually using drugs is only about 33%, so it is in fact 
 * more likely that the employee is not a drug user. The rarer the condition 
 * for which we are testing, the greater the percentage of positive tests that 
 * will be false positives.
 * 
 * p(A | B) = p(B | A) p(A) / p(B)
 * P(D|+) = p(+ | D) p(D) / p(+)
